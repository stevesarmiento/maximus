# Dexter ðŸ¤–

Dexter is an autonomous cryptocurrency research agent that thinks, plans, and learns as it works. It performs analysis using task planning, self-reflection, and real-time market data. Think Claude Code, but built specifically for cryptocurrency research.

## Overview

Dexter takes complex cryptocurrency questions and turns them into clear, step-by-step research plans. It runs those tasks using live market data, checks its own work, and refines the results until it has a confident, data-backed answer.  

Itâ€™s not just another chatbot.  Itâ€™s an agent that plans ahead, verifies its progress, and keeps iterating until the job is done.

**Key Capabilities:**
- **Intelligent Task Planning**: Automatically decomposes complex queries into structured research steps
- **Autonomous Execution**: Selects and executes the right tools to gather cryptocurrency data
- **Self-Validation**: Checks its own work and iterates until tasks are complete
- **Real-Time Crypto Data**: Access to prices, market data, OHLC charts, and coin information from CoinGecko
- **Flexible Identifiers**: Supports both CoinGecko IDs (bitcoin, ethereum) and ticker symbols (BTC, ETH)
- **Safety Features**: Built-in loop detection and step limits to prevent runaway execution

# OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
# COINGECKO_API_KEY=your-coingecko-api-key
```

### Usage

Run Dexter in interactive mode:
```bash
uv run dexter-agent
```

### Example Queries

Try asking Dexter questions like:
- "What is Bitcoin's current price and market cap?"
- "Compare the 30-day price performance of Ethereum and Solana"
- "What are the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap?"
- "Show me the 7-day OHLC data for BTC"
- "What are the trending cryptocurrencies right now?"
- "Get detailed information about Cardano"

Dexter will automatically:
1. Break down your question into research tasks
2. Fetch the necessary cryptocurrency data from CoinGecko
3. Perform calculations and analysis
4. Provide a comprehensive, data-rich answer

## Architecture

Dexter uses a multi-agent architecture with specialized components:

- **Planning Agent**: Analyzes queries and creates structured task lists
- **Action Agent**: Selects appropriate tools and executes research steps
- **Validation Agent**: Verifies task completion and data sufficiency
- **Answer Agent**: Synthesizes findings into comprehensive responses

## Available Tools

Dexter has access to the following cryptocurrency research tools:

**Price Data:**
- `get_price_snapshot`: Current price, market cap, volume, and 24h changes
- `get_historical_prices`: Historical price data over specified time periods
- `get_ohlc_data`: OHLC candlestick data for technical analysis

**Market Overview:**
- `get_top_cryptocurrencies`: Top cryptocurrencies ranked by market cap or volume
- `get_global_market_data`: Global crypto market statistics and metrics
