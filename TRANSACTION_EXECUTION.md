# Transaction Execution Implementation

## ✅ Complete! Swaps Now Execute On-Chain

Transaction execution has been **fully implemented**. The Titan integration now:

1. ✅ Connects to Titan WebSocket
2. ✅ Streams live quotes from multiple providers
3. ✅ Shows interactive live-updating table
4. ✅ Waits for user confirmation (Enter key)
5. ✅ **Signs transaction with delegate wallet**
6. ✅ **Sends to Solana network**
7. ✅ **Waits for confirmation**
8. ✅ **Returns transaction signature and Solscan link**

## 🎯 How It Works

### User Flow

```bash
$ uv run maximus

>> swap 0.05 SOL for USDC

╭─ Live Quotes
│ Provider        Route           In SOL    Out USDC    Rate
│ ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
│ ★ Jupiter       Raydium         0.0500    1.6250      32.50
│   Pyth Express  Direct          0.0500    1.6230      32.46
│
╰───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Press Enter to execute best quote, or Ctrl+C to cancel

[User presses Enter]

✅ Swap executed successfully!

Swapped: 0.05 SOL → 1.625000 USDC

```

### Technical Implementation

```python
# 1. Get transaction from Titan quote
tx_bytes = best_quote.transaction

# 2. Deserialize
from solders.transaction import VersionedTransaction
tx = VersionedTransaction.from_bytes(tx_bytes)

# 3. Sign with delegate wallet
tx.sign([keypair])

# 4. Send to network
signature = client.send_raw_transaction(bytes(tx))

# 5. Confirm
confirmation = client.confirm_transaction(signature)

# 6. Return result
return {
    "success": True,
    "signature": str(signature),
    "message": "Swap executed successfully!"
}
```

## 🔑 Prerequisites

### The delegate wallet must have tokens to swap!

**Option 1: Transfer Tokens to Delegate (Recommended)**

1. Find your delegate wallet address:
   ```bash
   uv run maximus
   # Shows: "Delegate wallet: A7kqBMxw...tTmosnXu"
   ```

2. Send tokens to that address:
   ```bash
   # From your main wallet, send:
   # - SOL for gas fees (~0.01 SOL minimum)
   # - Tokens you want to swap (e.g., 0.05 SOL or 10 USDC)
   ```

3. Now you can swap!

**Option 2: Token Delegation (Experimental)**

Visit `http://localhost:3000/approve-token` to approve the delegate to spend tokens from your main wallet without transferring them first.

Note: This is more complex and requires proper SPL token delegation setup.

## 🔒 Security Features

### Transaction Safety
- ✅ User must press Enter to confirm (can't accidentally execute)
- ✅ Shows full quote details before execution
- ✅ Respects delegation limits (max per transaction)
- ✅ Validates allowed programs (Titan, Jupiter, Raydium)
- ✅ Time-limited delegation (expires automatically)

### Error Handling
- ✅ Clear error if delegate lacks funds
- ✅ Helpful message if simulation fails
- ✅ Transaction failure doesn't lose funds
- ✅ Detailed error messages with solutions

## 🐛 Bug Fixes Included

### Fixed Decimal Handling

**Problem:** All tokens were treated as 6 decimals
- SOL has 9 decimals → was calculating wrong amounts
- Swapping 0.05 SOL sent only 0.00005 SOL!

**Solution:** Token-specific decimal configuration
```python
COMMON_TOKENS = {
    "SOL": {"decimals": 9},   # 1 SOL = 1 billion lamports
    "USDC": {"decimals": 6},  # 1 USDC = 1 million micro-USDC
    "USDT": {"decimals": 6},
    "BONK": {"decimals": 5},
    "JUP": {"decimals": 6},
}
```

Now amounts are calculated correctly!

### Fixed WebSocket Endpoint

**Problem:** Using wrong domain `api.titan.ag`
**Solution:** Updated to correct demo endpoints:
- US: `wss://us1.api.demo.titan.exchange/api/v1/ws`
- JP: `wss://jp1.api.demo.titan.exchange/api/v1/ws`
- DE: `wss://de1.api.demo.titan.exchange/api/v1/ws`

## 📊 Testing

### Test with Small Amounts First!

```bash
# Safe test amounts
>> swap 0.01 SOL for USDC    # ~$0.30
>> swap 1 USDC for SOL       # ~$1.00
>> swap 100 BONK for SOL     # ~$0.002
```

### What to Expect

**If Successful:**
```
✅ Swap executed successfully!
   Swapped: 0.01 SOL → 0.325 USDC
   Provider: Jupiter
   Transaction: 5K7Qp...
   View on Solscan: https://solscan.io/tx/...
```

**If Delegate Lacks Funds:**
```
❌ Insufficient funds in delegate wallet.
   The delegate wallet (A7kqBMxw...) doesn't have enough tokens.
   
   Solutions:
   1. Send 0.01 SOL to the delegate wallet
   2. Or approve token delegation via http://localhost:3000/approve-token
```

**If Simulation Fails:**
```
❌ Transaction simulation failed.
   This usually means:
   - Delegate wallet doesn't have the tokens
   - Token account doesn't exist
   - Slippage tolerance too tight
```

## 🚨 Important Warnings

### Real Money

This executes **real on-chain transactions** with **real money**:
- ❌ Cannot be undone once confirmed
- ❌ Gas fees are paid even if swap fails
- ❌ Slippage can cause unexpected amounts
- ✅ Always test with small amounts first!

### Delegate Wallet Security

Your delegate wallet:
- ✅ Has spending limits (enforced)
- ✅ Expires automatically (time-limited)
- ✅ Can be revoked anytime (`/revoke`)
- ❌ Should not hold large amounts
- ❌ Password should be strong & unique

### Network Conditions

Swaps can fail due to:
- Network congestion (high fees, slow confirmation)
- Price movement (slippage exceeded)
- Liquidity issues (not enough tokens in pool)
- Account state changes (someone else swapped first)

**Always double-check quotes before confirming!**
