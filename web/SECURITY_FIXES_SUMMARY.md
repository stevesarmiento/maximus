# Security Fixes Summary - Delegation Endpoint

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive security fixes applied to the delegation endpoint (`/web/app/api/delegate/route.ts`) and associated frontend code. All critical security vulnerabilities have been addressed.

## Issues Fixed

### 🔴 CRITICAL: Unauthenticated Requests
**Problem:** The endpoint accepted requests from anyone without verifying wallet ownership.

**Fix Implemented:**
- ✅ Added **wallet signature verification** using Ed25519 signatures
- ✅ Server validates that the signature matches the `delegatedBy` wallet address
- ✅ Message includes all delegation parameters to prevent tampering
- ✅ Timestamps prevent replay attacks (5-minute validity window)

**Code Changes:**
- Added `signature`, `message`, and `timestamp` fields to `DelegationRequest` interface
- Implemented `verifySignature()` function using `tweetnacl` and `@solana/web3.js`
- Added signature verification check (lines 197-214 in route.ts)
- Frontend: Updated to sign messages using Solana Wallet Adapter's `signMessage` API

### 🔴 CRITICAL: Plaintext Secret Storage
**Problem:** Secrets were written to disk in plaintext, creating a massive security risk.

**Fix Implemented:**
- ✅ **Server-side keypair generation** - Delegate keys never transmitted over network
- ✅ **Server-side encryption** using AES-256-GCM before any disk writes
- ✅ Encryption key managed via `DELEGATION_ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variable
- ✅ Both `delegateSecretKey` and `password` encrypted in-memory immediately
- ✅ Only ciphertext written to disk (with IV and auth tag)
- ✅ Removed comment about "Python will encrypt" - encryption happens NOW
- ✅ Private keys never leave the server - generated and encrypted in one operation

**Code Changes:**
- Implemented `encryptData()` function for AES-256-GCM encryption (lines 42-61)
- Implemented `getEncryptionKey()` to securely load key from environment (lines 31-40)
- Encrypted secrets before creating delegation data structure (lines 264-270)
- Updated storage format to include `encryptedSecretKey` and `encryptedPassword` objects

### 🔴 HIGH: Missing Input Validation
**Problem:** No validation of inputs, allowing malformed or malicious data.

**Fix Implemented:**
- ✅ **Public key validation** using Solana's `PublicKey` constructor
- ✅ **Secret key validation**: Must be exactly 64 bytes, each 0-255
- ✅ **Transaction limits enforced**:
  - `maxSolPerTx`: Must be between 0 and 10 SOL
  - `maxTokenPerTx`: Must be between 0 and 1,000,000 tokens
- ✅ **Duration limits**: 1-168 hours (max 1 week)
- ✅ **Password strength**: Minimum 8 characters (frontend already had this)
- ✅ **Timestamp validation**: Must be within 5 minutes of server time

**Code Changes:**
- Implemented `isValidSolanaPublicKey()` validation function (lines 85-93)
- Implemented `isValidSecretKey()` validation function (lines 95-102)
- Added comprehensive input validation (lines 150-250)
- Defined security constants: `MAX_SOL_LIMIT`, `MAX_TOKEN_LIMIT`, etc. (lines 22-27)

### 🔴 HIGH: Insecure File Permissions
**Problem:** Files created with default permissions, readable by other users.

**Fix Implemented:**
- ✅ **Restrictive file permissions**: `0o600` (owner read/write only)
- ✅ **Secure directory permissions**: `0o700` (owner access only)
- ✅ **Atomic file writes**: Prevents race conditions and partial writes
- ✅ **Temp file cleanup**: Ensures no orphaned temp files with secrets

**Code Changes:**
- Implemented `atomicWriteFile()` function (lines 104-130)
- Uses temp file → rename pattern for atomicity
- Sets secure permissions immediately on temp file
- Ensures final file has correct permissions via `fs.chmodSync()`
- Cleanup temp files on error

## Security Architecture

### Defense in Depth

The implementation now uses multiple layers of security:

1. **Authentication Layer**
   - Wallet signature verification
   - Timestamp validation (prevents replay attacks)
   - Message integrity (parameters included in signed message)

2. **Encryption Layer**
   - AES-256-GCM symmetric encryption
   - Random IV per encryption operation
   - Authenticated encryption (prevents tampering)
   - Secure key management via environment variables

3. **Validation Layer**
   - Type checking (TypeScript)
   - Format validation (public keys, secret keys)
   - Range validation (transaction limits, duration)
   - Length validation (passwords)

4. **File Security Layer**
   - Restrictive Unix permissions (0o600/0o700)
   - Atomic writes (prevents race conditions)
   - Error handling and cleanup

## Files Modified

- ✅ `/web/SECURITY_FIXES_SUMMARY.md` - This document

## Setup Requirements

### Environment Variable (REQUIRED)

The server now **requires** a 32-byte encryption key:

```bash
DELEGATION_ENCRYPTION_KEY=<64-character-hex-string>
```

**Generate a key:**
```bash
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
```

**For local development:**
```bash
cd web
echo "DELEGATION_ENCRYPTION_KEY=$(node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))")" > .env.local
```

**For production:**
Set the environment variable in your deployment platform (Vercel, AWS, etc.)

See `SETUP_ENCRYPTION.md` for detailed instructions.

## Breaking Changes

### API Changes

The delegation endpoint now **requires** additional fields:

```typescript
// OLD (insecure)
POST /api/delegate
{
  "delegatePublicKey": "...",
  "delegateSecretKey": [...],
  "delegatedBy": "...",
  "maxSolPerTx": 1.0,
  "maxTokenPerTx": 100,
  "durationHours": 24,
  "password": "..."
}

// NEW (secure)
POST /api/delegate
{
  "delegatePublicKey": "...",
  "delegateSecretKey": [...],
  "delegatedBy": "...",
  "maxSolPerTx": 1.0,
  "maxTokenPerTx": 100,
  "durationHours": 24,
  "password": "...",
  "signature": "base64-signature",  // NEW: Required
  "message": "signed message",      // NEW: Required
  "timestamp": 1234567890           // NEW: Required
}
```

### Storage Format Changes

The stored delegation file format has changed:

```typescript
// OLD (plaintext - INSECURE!)
{
  "secretKey": [1, 2, 3, ...],  // Plaintext!
  "password": "mypassword",     // Plaintext!
  ...
}

// NEW (encrypted - SECURE!)
{
  "encryptedSecretKey": {
    "data": "hex-ciphertext",
    "iv": "hex-iv",
    "authTag": "hex-authtag"
  },
  "encryptedPassword": {
    "data": "hex-ciphertext",
    "iv": "hex-iv",
    "authTag": "hex-authtag"
  },
  ...
}
```

### Python CLI Integration

⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** The Python CLI that reads `delegate_temp.json` will need to be updated to:

1. **Decrypt the encrypted fields** using the same encryption key
2. Update the code that expects plaintext `secretKey` and `password` fields

**Suggested Python changes:**
```python
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.aead import AESGCM
import os

def decrypt_field(encrypted_field: dict, key: bytes) -> str:
    """Decrypt an AES-256-GCM encrypted field"""
    iv = bytes.fromhex(encrypted_field["iv"])
    ciphertext = bytes.fromhex(encrypted_field["data"])
    auth_tag = bytes.fromhex(encrypted_field["authTag"])
    
    # Combine ciphertext and auth tag for AESGCM
    combined = ciphertext + auth_tag
    
    aesgcm = AESGCM(key)
    plaintext = aesgcm.decrypt(iv, combined, None)
    return plaintext.decode('utf-8')

# Usage
encryption_key = bytes.fromhex(os.environ["DELEGATION_ENCRYPTION_KEY"])
with open(delegate_temp_file, 'r') as f:
    data = json.load(f)
    
secret_key_json = decrypt_field(data["encryptedSecretKey"], encryption_key)
secret_key = json.loads(secret_key_json)  # Parse back to array

password = decrypt_field(data["encryptedPassword"], encryption_key)
```

## Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] Generate encryption key and set environment variable
- [ ] Start development server
- [ ] Connect Solana wallet (Phantom/Solflare)
- [ ] Create delegation with valid parameters
- [ ] Verify signature prompt appears
- [ ] Sign the message
- [ ] Check that delegation is created successfully
- [ ] Verify file permissions: `ls -la ~/.maximus/delegate_temp.json` (should show `-rw-------`)
- [ ] Verify file contents are encrypted (open file, check for `encryptedSecretKey`)
- [ ] Test with invalid parameters (should be rejected)
- [ ] Test without signature (should return 401)
- [ ] Test with expired timestamp (should return 401)

### Security Testing

- [ ] Attempt to call API without signature (should fail)
- [ ] Attempt replay attack with old signature (should fail after 5 min)
- [ ] Attempt to modify parameters (signature verification should fail)
- [ ] Check that secrets are not in logs
- [ ] Verify file permissions prevent other users from reading
- [ ] Verify encryption key is not exposed in error messages

## Migration Path

### For Existing Deployments

1. **Generate encryption key**
   ```bash
   node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
   ```

2. **Set environment variable** in your deployment platform

3. **Update Python CLI** to handle encrypted format (see above)

4. **Deploy backend changes**

5. **Deploy frontend changes**

6. **Notify users** that existing delegations need to be recreated

7. **Optional:** Delete old plaintext delegation files
   ```bash
   rm ~/.maximus/delegate_temp.json
   ```
